# Multimedia-Design-and-Programming

Here are some neat mini projects in python that I created while in class that could be helpful to others and can be used as reference. Some of the projects use different types of libraries and class that you will need to install or import to be able to use. 

## Getting Started

### Installing

You can look through the folders individually to find the projects that you need or just clone this repository to your terminal if you like.
